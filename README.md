Welcome to my Sinatra Project!

This is an app that is designed for you chefs who never remember what you put into your dishes.  Like me, I know what it's like.  I just throw in whatever I have around because I'm an unemployed student not living with mom or dad.  This app will make you remember so next time you visit your local supermarket, you will know what to buy instead of staring at 100+ seasonings and 50+ vegetables/meats.

In this sinatra app, I will do the following:
1. Build an MVC Sinatra Application.
2. Use ActiveRecord with Sinatra.
3. Use Multiple Models.
4. Use at least one has_many relationship
5. Must have user accounts. The user that created a given piece of content should be the only person who can modify that content
6. Must have the abilty to create, read, update and destroy the resource that belongs to a user and only that user is able to edit it.
7. You should also have validations for user input to ensure that bad data isn't added to the database. The fields in your signup form should be required and the user attribute that is used to login a user should be a unique value in the DB before creating the user.


Please remember to:
1. fork
2. bundle install
3. rake db:migrate

before you shotgun!

Thank you!
